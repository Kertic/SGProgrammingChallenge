Brennan Rodriguez's Submission for the Scientific Games Programming Challenge
I've chosen Problem 1 (Given a list of people with their birth and end years (all between 1900 and 2000), find the year with the most number of people alive.)
NOTE: My program only considers someone "alive" during a certain year if they're alive at the conclusion of that year.

There is a DataSet.txt (and corresponding .bin for internal use) that can be used with the program, and inside of the program there is a line you can uncomment to regenerate a new data set(both the .bin and .txt)

The results are printed to the console and saved to Results.txt
